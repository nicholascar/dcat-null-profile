# DCAT null Profile

This is a 'null' profile of the [Data Catalogue Vocabulary (DCAT)](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/).

Being a 'null' profile means this profile implements no rules in addition to DCAT's and exists only to assist automated validation tooling by providing validators for DCAT and a profile persistent identifier, to be used as a conformance target for data wanting to show conformance to DCAT's rules. This is necissary since DCAT doesn't provide such things.

The persistent identifier for this profile is:

* [**https://w3id.org/profile/dcatnull**](https://w3id.org/profile/dcatnull)

The validation rules here are inferred from the DCAT specification.
